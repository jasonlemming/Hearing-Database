## üìä Database Health Overview

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Committees | 214 | ‚úÖ |
| Parent Committees | 53 | ‚úÖ |
| Subcommittees | 161 | ‚úÖ |
| System Code Coverage | 100% | ‚úÖ |
| Hearing Associations | 1,168 | ‚úÖ |
| Data Integrity Issues | 0 | ‚úÖ |

**Chamber Distribution:**
- House: 23 committees
- Senate: 21 committees
- Joint: 9 committees

## üö® Issues by Priority

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (1 issue)
- **Server Configuration**: HTTP testing revealed server startup issues (likely environment configuration)

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (7 issues)
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Form elements missing ARIA labels
- **Collapse Controls**: Bootstrap collapse toggles need `aria-expanded` attributes
- **Screen Reader Support**: Select dropdowns need proper labeling

### **LOW PRIORITY** (1 issue)
- **Bootstrap Consistency**: Template should inherit version from base.html

---

## üîß Specific Code Issues Identified

### Template: `committees.html`

**Lines requiring attention:**
- **Line 23, 34, 45**: Select elements need `aria-label` or proper `<label>` associations
- **Line 57**: Filter button missing ARIA attributes
- **Line 116**: Collapse toggles missing `aria-expanded="false"` initial state

**Example Fix:**
```html
<!-- Current -->
<select class="form-select" id="chamber" name="chamber">

<!-- Recommended -->
<select class="form-select" id="chamber" name="chamber" aria-label="Filter by chamber">
```

## üí° Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions** (This Sprint)
1. **Add ARIA labels** to all form controls in filter section
2. **Fix collapse toggles** with proper `aria-expanded` attributes
3. **Test server configuration** for HTTP interface issues

### **Next Sprint**
1. **Implement automated accessibility testing** to prevent regression
2. **Add keyboard navigation testing** to audit suite
3. **Document accessibility guidelines** for future development

### **Long-term**
1. **Integrate audit tools** into CI/CD pipeline
2. **Create accessibility component library** for consistent implementations
3. **Add performance monitoring** to template rendering
