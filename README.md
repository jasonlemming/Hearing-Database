# Congressional Hearing Database

A public-facing tool for exploring congressional committee hearings, witness testimony, and legislative activity. Track what's happening in Congress through an accessible web interface and powerful data management tools.

**Live Demo**: [Deployed on Vercel](https://hearing-database.vercel.app) (if applicable)

## What Can You Do With This?

## Database Schema

The SQLite database tracks comprehensive congressional hearing data:

**Core Tables**:
- `hearings` - Hearing metadata (title, date, chamber, status, type)
- `committees` - Committee and subcommittee information
- `members` - Congressional members with party and state
- `witnesses` - Witness information (name, title, organization)

**Relationship Tables**:
- `hearing_committees` - Links hearings to committees
- `hearing_transcripts` - Transcript URLs and metadata
- `witness_appearances` - Witness testimony records
- `witness_documents` - Witness written statements
- `supporting_documents` - Additional hearing materials
- `committee_memberships` - Member committee assignments

**Tracking Tables**:
- `sync_tracking` - Import/update history
- `update_logs` - Daily update metrics
- `import_errors` - Error tracking

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.8+ with Flask web framework
- **Database**: SQLite (portable, serverless-friendly)
- **API**: Congress.gov API v3 (5,000 requests/hour limit)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with vanilla JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automated daily cron jobs
- **CLI**: Click framework for command-line interface

## Data Scope & Philosophy

### Current Focus
- **119th Congress** (2025-2027) - Currently active congress
- **Historical Archive** - Data accumulates over time (will retain 119th when 120th starts)
- **Metadata Focus** - Stores links to documents rather than full text (lightweight approach)
- **Public Data** - All data sourced from official Congress.gov API

### Out of Scope (Current)
- Bill tracking (schema exists but low priority)
- Full-text document storage/search
- Historical backfill to prior congresses (possible future enhancement)

## Use Cases

### Civic Engagement
- Monitor hearings on topics you care about
- See which organizations testify before Congress
- Track your representatives' committee activities
- Access official hearing documents and transcripts

### Research & Analysis
- Study witness testimony patterns and organizational representation
- Analyze committee hearing frequency and topics
- Track legislative oversight activities
- Export data for custom analysis

### Journalism & Transparency
- Quick lookup of hearing information
- Verify witness testimony claims
- Monitor congressional activity timelines
- Access primary source documents

## API Endpoints

Public JSON API for programmatic access:

- `GET /api/stats` - Database statistics
- `GET /api/update-status` - Daily update status and history
- `GET /api/debug` - System diagnostic information

See [API Reference](docs/reference/API_REFERENCE.md) for complete documentation.

## Configuration

Key environment variables (`.env` file):

```bash
# Required
CONGRESS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional
DATABASE_PATH=database.db          # Database file location
TARGET_CONGRESS=119                # Congress to import
BATCH_SIZE=50                      # Import batch size
UPDATE_WINDOW_DAYS=30              # Daily update lookback window
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                     # Logging verbosity
```

## Development

### Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest

# Format code
black .
```

### Running Locally
```bash
# Start web server
python cli.py web serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000

# Or run Flask app directly
python web/app.py  # Runs on port 8000
```

## Deployment

The system is designed for Vercel serverless deployment with automated daily updates:

- Vercel handles web hosting and serverless functions
- Cron job triggers daily data sync at 6am UTC
- SQLite database deployed with the application
- Read-mostly workload optimized for Vercel's serverless environment

See [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## Performance & Limitations

### Current Scale
- **Database Size**: ~4.5 MB (1,168 hearings with full metadata)
- **API Rate Limit**: 5,000 requests/hour (Congress.gov)
- **Update Time**: ~5-10 minutes for daily incremental updates
- **Full Import**: ~30-60 minutes for complete 119th Congress import

### SQLite Considerations
- Excellent for read-heavy workloads (web browsing)
- Single-writer limitation (appropriate for daily batch updates)
- Portable and serverless-friendly
- May need migration to PostgreSQL if scale significantly increases

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Areas of interest:

- Additional data visualizations
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Alternative transcript data source integration
- Historical congress backfill
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements

Please open an issue to discuss major changes before submitting PRs.

## Roadmap

### Potential Future Enhancements
- **Full-text search** of transcript content (if alternative data source identified)
- **Historical backfill** to prior congresses (118th, 117th, etc.)
- **Advanced analytics** dashboard with charts and trends
- **Export capabilities** (CSV, JSON) for custom analysis
- **Email notifications** for committee/member activity
- **Mobile-responsive** improvements
