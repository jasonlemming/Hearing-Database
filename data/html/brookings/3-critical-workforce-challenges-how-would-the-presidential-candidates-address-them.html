<h3>More good jobs and skilled workers</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Too few jobs in the U.S.— especially for workers without college degrees—pay family-sustaining wages and benefits.

<h3>Growing the workforce as baby boomers retire</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Separate from the quality of jobs and workers, the numbers and rates of </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">labor force participation</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in the U.S. have been declining, making it harder for employers to fill </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSJOR" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">vacant jobs</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. The ongoing </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022081pap.pdf" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">retirements of baby boomers has also contributed to declining labor force participation</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">high job vacancy rates</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> across the U.S. economy, and will continue to do so. </span><a href="https://www.econ.umd.edu/sites/www.econ.umd.edu/files/pubs/jep.36.1.151.pdf" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">Low birth rates</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in the U.S. will exacerbate these problems over the next few decades. Of course, even before baby boomer retirements began, </span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.2.163" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">less-educated men</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> had been dropping out of the labor force while </span><a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/31916.html" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">women’s participation has been relatively flat</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for 25 years; the recent retirements and low birth rates only exacerbate those ongoing problems.

<h3>Preparing for AI</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/machines-of-mind-how-generative-ai-will-power-the-coming-productivity-boom/"><span data-contrast="none">AI will almost certainly raise labor market productivity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and the overall standard of living in the U.S. But its implementation throughout our economy might also raise the rate of worker dislocation and displacement. When workers are permanently displaced from their jobs, they often suffer </span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180652" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">long-term wage or employment loss</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~yagan/Hysteresis.pdf" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">Such job loss has been large and lasting after the Great Recession</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This is especially evident in previously industrialized regions where jobs were eliminated due to </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25438" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">digital technology</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w21906" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">imports from China</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">; less-educated men and women were broadly hurt by these developments.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We do not yet know the extent to which AI will dislocate workers, nor which workers will face displacement. Historically, </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-the-impact-of-automation-on-workers-jobs-and-wages/"><span data-contrast="none">new technologies “complement” some workers, raising the demand for their labor, while “substituting” for others</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, who are broadly hurt. Some early indications suggest that </span><a href="https://cosm.aei.org/the-age-of-uncertainty-and-opportunity-work-in-the-age-of-ai/" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">less-educated workers might actually benefit</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from these new technologies, enabling them to be hired into jobs for which they previously were unprepared, while </span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/event/ai-workforce-international-economic-outlook/" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">college graduates in professional jobs will be at greater risk.</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> A lot depends on the extent to which employers will seek to retrain their incumbent workers to perform newer tasks, and how workers respond to these new developments by updating their skills or relocating to new regions where demand for them is higher. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<div class="byo-block -narrow wysiwyg-block wysiwyg">
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How would the candidates address these challenges?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As president, both Donald Trump and Joe Biden enacted policies they claim would address at least some of these worker and labor force needs, in very different ways. Their past policies give us some indication of what we might expect in a second term for each, though new challenges might require each to consider new approaches.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">During his term in office, Trump relied mostly on tax cuts and deregulation, as well as restricting imports and immigrants, to generate more and better jobs for U.S. workers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) likely bolstered consumer and labor demand, leading to at least </span><a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/papers/2020/wp2001#:~:text=While%20the%20estimates%20are%20imprecise,the%20labor%20force%20participation%20rate." target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">some rise in employment and labor force participation</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and the tight market probably raised wage growth a bit. But more personal tax cuts could be inflationary and lead to higher interest rates if implemented when the labor market remains tight. Cuts in corporate taxes could also produce more investments and higher worker wages in theory, though </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210628_TPC_GaleHaldeman_TCJASupplySideEffectsReport_FINAL.pdf"><span data-contrast="none">the TCJA does not seem to have done so</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump’s deregulatory efforts also could, at least in theory, lower employer costs and raise employment, though his </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/examining-some-of-trumps-deregulation-efforts-lessons-from-the-brookings-regulatory-tracker/"><span data-contrast="none">ability to eliminate regulations was more limited</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> than he had hoped. A second Trump term would produce more deregulatory efforts, while promoting virtually no new regulation (or federal spending) on job training, labor standards, child care or AI.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The administration’s approach to the global economy can also have consequences for employment. Trump’s first-term tariffs on foreign goods and even inputs (like aluminum and steel) do not seem to have raised </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32082" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">domestic employment</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Immigration declines during his term, and especially during the pandemic, might have modestly raised domestic employment. But declining immigration also contributed to the problem of a smaller labor force and “</span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BPEA_Spring2023_Abraham-Rendell_unembargoed.pdf"><span data-contrast="none">missing workers</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">” in 2021-22, while the </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-immigration-estimates-help-make-sense-of-the-pace-of-employment/"><span data-contrast="none">recovery of immigration since then has helped maintain labor force growth</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Trump promises much more severe immigration actions in a second term, especially towards the undocumented. Such actions could potentially generate more jobs and increase wages a bit for native-born workers, though mostly in industries (nondurable manufacturing, residential construction, household services) that require relatively few skills and pay low wages, while the labor force would shrink.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Finally, his efforts to raise skills among U.S. workers focused primarily on </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/betsy-devos-for-profit-colleges.html" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">bolstering for-profit occupational programs</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and encouraging </span><a href="https://www.apprenticeship.gov/sites/default/files/IRAP_General_Fact_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">industry-recognized apprenticeships</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> outside of the Labor Department’s registration process.  These changes were not in place for long enough for us to judge their efficacy, though reducing the burdens of registration on employers is a worthy goal. In Department of Labor training programs, the Trump administration relied primarily on encouraging </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-proposes-merging-education-and-labor-departments" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">streamlining</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-executive-order-workforce-development/" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">targeting of existing programs</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. We would likely see more such efforts in a second Trump administration.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In contrast, the Biden administration has approached workforce policy by generating new investments worth hundreds of billions of dollars in job creation and training, while supporting stronger labor standards and union representation to raise worker pay. The new jobs and investments in skill-building are primarily driven by his 2021 relief bill (the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/07/fact-sheet-department-of-education-announces-state-by-state-american-rescue-plan-funding-for-colleges-and-universities/" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">American Rescue Plan Act</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, or ARPA) and three bills to spur American industry: the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to promote sustainable energy; the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill (BIL) to promote transportation and universal access to broadband; and the CHIPS and Science Act to promote U.S. production of semiconductors and other advanced technology products. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The three bills constitute a new form of U.S. “</span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bidens-big-bet-on-place-based-industrial-policy/"><span data-contrast="none">industrial policy</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">,” with investments in key industries, often targeted to </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/breaking-down-an-80-billion-surge-in-place-based-industrial-policy/"><span data-contrast="none">regions that have stagnated economically</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in recent decades. There is a strong preference for </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/IRA" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">unionized workers or labor standards</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> written into these laws. And all three bills create new jobs for highly-skilled workers, both with and without BA degrees. Funds in all three bills will therefore be used for </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-federal-state-and-local-leaders-can-leverage-the-chips-and-science-act-as-a-landmark-workforce-opportunity/"><span data-contrast="none">workforce development</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and efforts are underway to develop training programs with these funds in all three cases. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The extent to which these efforts will be successful, in terms of cost-effectively meeting their respective goals and creating new jobs filled with skilled workers, will not be known for a number of years. A second term for Biden would allow his administration to further implement these plans, and their effects on workers could then be measured over time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Furthermore, Biden has recently implemented new regulations on </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/02/29/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-rule-reduce-costs-more-than-100000-families-receiving-child-care-subsidies.html#:~:text=Reducing%20costs%20to%20families%3A%20The,disability%2C%20and%20other%20vulnerable%20families." target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">child care affordability</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-scaling-and-expanding-the-use-of-registered-apprenticeships-in-industries-and-the-federal-government-and-promoting-labor-management-forums/" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">apprenticeship</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">—which should raise parental employment and worker skills respectively as long as any new regulations to ensure quality don’t raise costs and impede their implementation.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Biden administration initially liberalized immigration enforcement, which successfully bolstered the size of the labor force as we recovered from the pandemic. But political pressures in response to the huge flows of Central and South Americans at our southern border seeking asylum have forced the administration to move to a </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/immigration-policy-could-determine-the-next-president-of-the-united-states/"><span data-contrast="none">more restrictive policy stance</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. New legislation could, in theory, provide needed worker flows into employment while tightening border security, though the odds of any new legislation on this politically charged issue seem remote. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Finally, the Biden administration has begun a process of considering </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">new regulation of AI</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, to prevent abuses while hopefully not impeding its development and use by industry. It is far too early to ascertain whether those actions will be successful, and new efforts to limit worker displacement still need to be developed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In sum, a second term for Trump would likely emphasize tax cuts and deregulation, along with restrictions on trade and immigration, to spur more and better job-creation. A second Biden term would allow more time to implement his place-based “industrial policy” and especially its skill-building components. The two candidates and campaigns thus offer stark differences in how the labor market challenges of the next few decades will be addressed. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
