<div><p>Across the country, men coerce or even force pregnant women to take pills that induce an abortion. Some of these use abortion pills to cover up abuse. We have no way to know the full scope of this problem. But we do know that this problem will get worse – not better – if pro-abortion policymakers continue to champion the abortion industry at the expense of women’s health and safety.</p>
<p>The Biden administration recently gutted safety protocols on dangerous abortion drugs that had stood for more than 20 years. No longer must a doctor see a woman in-person to rule out life-threatening risks or accurately date a pregnancy. Now the Food and Drug Administration endorses telemedicine abortion and abortion pill-by-mail.</p>
<p>These drugs hurt women and end the lives of thousands of unborn children every year. But the abortion industry isn’t stopping here. The goal isn’t just to treat abortion drugs like any other prescription drug. It’s to make abortion pills available over-the-counter.</p>
<p>Coerced and forced abortions are already happening. And every time safety protocols are degraded, it becomes easier for an unsupportive partner, abuser, or trafficker to harm women, girls, and unborn children. Stories like the ones below will become more common unless policymakers act to stop these tragedies.</p>

<h2>Real-life Cases</h2>
<p>Heritage has compiled publicly documented cases related to abortion pill abuse and coercion. The perpetrators used similar methods: secretly <strong>crushing</strong> the pill into food and drink, sneakily <strong>swapping </strong>the pill for a different drug, or <strong>coercing</strong> the victim into taking the pill with and sometimes without her knowledge.</p>

<h3>Crushed into Food or Drink</h3>

<h4 class="image-aside-h4" style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: .25rem; font-weight: 500 !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; opacity: .75;">Texas 2025</h4>
<ul style="margin-left: -16px;">
<li>In 2025, <strong>Justin Anthony Banta</strong> was taken into custody to be <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/justin-anthony-banta-arrested-capital-murder-unborn-baby-tarrant-parker-counties-investigation/" target="_blank">charged</a> with capital murder and tampering with evidence. Upon learning she was pregnant, Banta’s girlfriend wanted to keep her child but Banta suggested an abortion. Her child had a strong heartbeat and appeared healthy on an ultrasound when she was about six weeks pregnant in October 2024. Banta allegedly ordered abortion pills online and crushed the pills into her <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article308230115.html" target="_blank">coffee</a> later that day without her knowledge. Several days later she went to an emergency room after experiencing heavy bleeding, discovering that her unborn child was dead. The county sheriff’s office also alleges that Banta remotely reset his phone, which had been seized as evidence, “deleting crucial evidence related to the case."</li>

<li><meta charset="utf-8"/>In early 2025, <strong>Christopher Cooprider</strong>’s girlfriend became pregnant with a baby girl. According to a wrongful death <a href="https://eppc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1-Complaint-8.11.2025_compressed.pdf" target="_blank">complaint</a>, Cooprider consistently pressured her to have an abortion, but his girlfriend refused. Ignoring her repeated objections, Cooprider obtained pills from AidAccess—a website operated by a Dutch doctor, Rebecca Gomperts, who illegally ships pills into the United States from international sources. Text messages in the complaint show him becoming increasingly hostile, and his girlfriend eventually told him to stop texting and harassing her. Eventually Cooprider invited his girlfriend over for a “trust building night.” His girlfriend was about eight weeks pregnant. He laced her hot chocolate with the abortion pills he purchased from AidAccess. According to the complaint, she started cramping and hemorrhaging withing 30 minutes. She scrambled to arrange childcare so Cooprider could take her to the emergency room, but instead he abandoned her and stopped responding to calls and texts. When his girlfriend finally made her way to the ER, it was too late for her baby.</li>

She went to the hospital with severe cramping and bleeding. She eventually gave birth to her baby prematurely. The forced induction charge was downgraded to injury to a child. In 2024 Herring was <a href="https://abc13.com/mason-herring-denied-sentence-reduction-houston-attorney-accused-of-forcing-induction-to-have-an-abortion/14728446/" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to 180 days in prison and 10 years probation.</p>

<h4 class="image-aside-h4" style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: .25rem; font-weight: 500 !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; opacity: .75;">Massachusetts 2024</h4>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"/>In August of 2025, <strong>Emerson Evans</strong> was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cityblmPD/photos/intentional-homicide-of-an-unborn-childan-adult-male-has-been-arrested-for-unlaw/1203380975154994/?_rdr" target="_blank">arrested</a> and charged with two counts of intentional homicide of an unborn child. He  <a href="https://www.wglt.org/local-news/2025-08-23/man-faces-homicide-charge-after-allegedly-slipping-pregnant-girlfriend-the-abortion-pill" target="_blank">allegedly</a> put abortion pills in his girlfriend’s vagina without her knowledge or consent. His girlfriend was approximately 7 weeks pregnant at the time. Evans claimed he bought mifepristone pills for $50 “from a girl on campus.” The victim told police that Evans wanted her to have an abortion but she did not. Evans <a href="https://ipmnewsroom.org/mclean-county-judge-holds-man-in-custody-in-homicide-of-unborn-child-case/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> told police that he “made the decision for her.”</p>
<h4 class="image-aside-h4" style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: 3rem !important; font-weight: 500 !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; opacity: .75;">Washington 2024</h4>
<p><b>David Coots</b>, a nurse practitioner, was <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article286695865.html" target="_blank">charged</a> with assault, third degree rape, and witness tampering after allegedly forcing a misoprostol pill into a woman’s vagina during sexual intercourse. Coots had led the woman to believe that he was excited about her pregnancy. Coots claimed that he prescribed the misoprostol for himself. The victim was suspicious and sought emergency care, at which point more misoprostol was discovered inside her. After days of bleeding and stomach pain, she was no longer pregnant. <meta charset="utf-8"/>In summer 2025 Coots pleaded guilty to both second and fourth-degree assault as well as tampering with a witness. He was <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article310406320.html" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to one year and one day in prison and may not contact the victim for 10 years.</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"/>New York abortionist Dr. Margaret Carpenter, along with a Louisiana woman, were <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dr-margaret-carpenter-indictment-louisiana.pdf" target="_blank">indicted</a> by a Louisiana grand jury for violating the state’s law prohibiting abortion pills. According to the district attorney, the Louisiana woman obtained the pills via Dr. Carpenter and <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2025/01/31/la-grand-jury-indicts-ny-doctor-who-prescribed-abortion-pill-local-teen-took/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=snd&amp;utm_content=wafb" target="_blank">told</a> her pregnant daughter, a minor, that “she had to take the pill or else.” The young girl reportedly ended up in the <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/02/12/extradition-doctor/" target="_blank">emergency room</a> after suffering significant bleeding. She had reportedly been planning a gender reveal party for her child, which indicates that she desired to keep her baby. Instead she was allegedly coerced to take have an abortion she didn’t want with pills recklessly prescribed by a doctor who had reportedly never even evaluated her or spoken with her.</p>
<h4 class="image-aside-h4" style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: 3rem !important; font-weight: 500 !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; opacity: .75;">Florida 2023</h4>
<p><b>Haley Raborn</b> was <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/hcso-woman-tries-to-pay-father-to-kill-his-unborn-child-with-airpods" target="_blank">charged</a> with solicitation and attempted murder on an unborn child by injury to the mother, and tampering with/fabricating physical evidence. Raborn allegedly attempted to have the ex-fiance of the victim kill his 11-week old unborn child with an abortion pill. Instead, the ex-fiance turned the pill over to law enforcement. Raborn claimed that she got the pill from an online telemedicine doctor, which is illegal under Florida law.</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"/><meta charset="utf-8"/>Rosalie Markezich found out she was pregnant and wanted to keep her child. Her boyfriend, originally supportive, decided he did not want her to have their child and <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2025/09/22/women-allegedly-coerced-into-abortion-intervenes-in-major-case-challenging-mail-order-pill/" target="_blank">coerced</a> her to have an abortion she didn’t want. Rosalie is now attempting to <a href="https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/177118007536-1.pdf" target="_blank">intervene</a> in a case challenging the Biden FDA’s reckless decision to do away with the very safeguards that, had they been in place, could have protected Rosalie and her baby. In a sworn <a href="https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/72fdbeff-bf3e-4ede-995c-e3175a91ae0e.pdf" target="_blank">declaration</a>, Rosalie described how her boyfriend’s sister advised him how to order drugs from an online pharmacy. He filled out a form online using her information; the only interaction Rosalie had with a medical provider was to send payment for the drugs, which were shipped from California via USPS. Her boyfriend, who she says had anger issues and a criminal record, repeatedly pressured her to take the drugs. Rosalie says she had previously suffered domestic abuse, and was terrified when her boyfriend had her cornered in a car alone, shouting at her. She feared for her safety and says she took the drugs in front of him to pacify him, and planned to throw them up as soon as possible. She wasn’t able to get away from him in time, and to this day Rosalie says she grieves for the child she was forced to abort and is haunted by the trauma.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom:0;">What to do</h2>
<hr/>
<p style="margin-top:16px;">Women and girls deserve better.</p>
<p>Policymakers at the state and federal level must act – but how? For starters, they should:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Prohibit telemedicine and mail-order abortions,</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Strengthen informed consent requirements,</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Strengthen or enact laws regarding abortion coercion,</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Strengthen or enact parental consent laws for minors, and</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Strengthen or laws regarding forced abortion which seek justice for both victims – unborn children and their mothers.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Roe v. Wade in the dustbin of history, abortion pills are the abortion industry’s answer to undermine pro-life progress. Americans should know that removing commonsense safety protocols will mean even more women and girls will face abuse and coercion. No matter what you think about abortion, everyone should agree that nobody should be coerced or forced to have an abortion against her will. At every level of government, policy should protect women, girls, and unborn children – not abusers.</p>
