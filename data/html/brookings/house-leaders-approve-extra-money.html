And they’re now going to get even more money to deal with threats.  Amid growing concerns after the killing of a conservative political activist in Utah, House leaders last night approved plans to let lawmakers spend up to $10,000 per month on personal security for the next two months.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>SECURITY.</strong><span>   The plan doubles a pilot program announced in July.  "These additional funds will go a long way in ensuring lawmakers can continue to do their jobs without fear," said Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI).  "More needs to be done," added Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY), "but this is an important and necessary start."</span></p></li><li><p><strong>HOUSE ADMIN.</strong><span>  Steil and Morelle are the top two members on the House Administration Committee, which is responsible for day-to-day operations of the House.  </span><a href="https://cha.house.gov/press-releases?id=0DAFC408-2436-4A31-AB72-C493F3E8B967" rel="">In a joint release</a><span>, they left no doubt about their support for extra security aid.  "The threat level for Members remains high,” they said.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>FUNDING.</strong><span>   This new plan was announced a day after Republicans unveiled a stopgap spending bill which contained $30 million in funding for extra security for Congress, $30 million to protect various Executive Branch officials, and $28 million to bolster security at the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>BUDGET.</strong><span>  The entire budget for Congress and the Legislative Branch is about $7.5 billion.  (It's a bargain compared to the rest of the federal government.)  Of that, the Capitol Police and security budget is now closing in on $1 billion.  </span></p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png" rel="" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":450,"width":719,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":715072,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":"image/png","href":null,"belowTheFold":false,"topImage":true,"internalRedirect":"https://jamiedupree.substack.com/i/173855534?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png","isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' fetchpriority="high" height="450" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vLF4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a7639f1-86de-48f0-8f0a-1620ac11451d_719x450.png 1456w" width="719"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr/></div><p><strong>ECONOMY.</strong><span>    We all know that inflation is bad for the economy.  But stagflation is even worse.  And as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by one-quarter of a point on Wednesday, there were some concerning observations from the Federal Reserve about the U.S. economy.  Are we seeing hints of the late 1970’s stagflation under Jimmy Carter?  Maybe.  </span></p><ul><li><p><strong>CONFLICTING CHOICES.</strong><span>  "There’s no risk-free path," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters about the Fed’s monetary policy choices.  There are conflicting goals right now - how do you suppress inflation while also trying to spur new economic and job growth?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>CONDITIONS.</strong><span>   If you’re not familiar with ‘stagflation,’ it is a combination of sluggish economic growth, high inflation, and high unemployment.  While we don't really have the last two, inflation and the jobless rate have been ticking up in recent months. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>REVIEW.</strong><span>  "Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year," </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm" rel="">the Fed statement began</a><span>.  "Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.  Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated."</span></p></li><li><p><strong>CAP HILL.</strong><span>  Democrats were ready.  "Stagflation is here thanks to Trump," tweeted Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL), as Democrats blamed Trump's tariffs and trade war with the world.  "Donald Trump is a disaster for American workers, businesses, and consumers," added Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>IMPORT DUTIES.</strong><span>  Are the Trump tariffs to blame for increasing inflation?  "Higher tariffs have begun to push up prices," Powell told reporters, "but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen." </span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>TARIFFS.</strong><span>   A few hours after Powell’s appearance, House Republicans backtracked a bit on tariffs, as GOP lawmakers voted to block any efforts to repeal the Trump tariffs through Jan. 31, 2026.  That plan was approved 216-210 along party lines, as part of a plan setting up debate on a temporary government funding bill.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.</strong><span>  Originally, House GOP leaders wanted to block any votes on tariffs through March 31 - but a mini-rebellion of Republicans on Tuesday forced this change back to the end of January.  </span></p></li><li><p><strong>GAG RULE.</strong><span>   It still means no direct votes on tariffs for at least another 4-plus months in the House.  It has some Republicans concerned, as one GOP lawmaker actually acknowledged the tariff situation on the House floor.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS</strong><span>.   "There are increasing signs of tariff-related damage to the economy," said Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA).  "Tariffs by definition raise prices and they are a tax," the California Republican added.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>WAITING.</strong><span>  For now though, Republicans seem ready to wait for President Trump - hoping the threat of tariffs will produce trade deals that open foreign markets to American exports and farm products.  But the clock is ticking.</span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>CAPITOL HILL.</strong><span>  There are some days in the halls of Congress that make you shake your head.  Wednesday was one of them.  These next three stories fit that bill.</span></p><div><hr/></div><p><strong>(1) MAN BITES DOG.</strong><span>   I told you yesterday that a hearing called by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) on the ouster of top officials at the Centers for Disease Control stuck out like a sore thumb.   And that’s exactly how it played out, as two former CDC officials pummeled HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - in a hearing called by the GOP.   It was crazy.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>REK JR.</strong><span>   You can bet the headlines were not what the White House was looking for - but it's what they got from Cassidy.  "Ex-officials at CDC tell Senators how Kennedy is risking public health," boomed the New York Times last night.   </span></p></li><li><p><strong>IRKED.</strong><span>  "There was no reason for today’s hearing," grumbled Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) last night, as the Oklahoma Republican repeatedly accused ex-CDC chief Susan Monarez of lying.  </span></p></li><li><p><strong>VIDEOTAPE.</strong><span>  At one point, Mullin claimed there was a recording of a pivotal meeting between Monarez and Kennedy.  A few hours later, Mullin admitted there wasn’t - but he still called Monarez a ‘liar.’</span></p></li><li><p><strong>VACCINES.</strong><span>  In her testimony, Monarez accused Kennedy of trying to get her to back federal changes to childhood vaccine recommendations - no matter whether there was scientific data to back it up.  </span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>MEA CULPA.</strong><span>  One Democrat told Monarez that his vote against her nomination back in July was a mistake.  "I had concern about your backbone, and I was wrong," said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA).  "It's important when you're wrong to admit you're wrong."</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>IRONY.</strong><span>  That was somewhat of an ironic moment - as Democrats pressed Monarez to tell the story of what had gone on in her one month at the CDC.  And yet they did not believe in her to begin with.</span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>(2) OMAR.</strong><span>  The House last night narrowly defeated a GOP effort to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).  Four Republicans cast the key votes, as the House killed a plan from Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) to strip Omar of her committee assignments over comments Omar made about conservative activist Charlie Kirk.  The vote was 214-213.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>DEFEAT.</strong><span>   "They voted to shield a woman who mocked the cold-blooded assassination of Charlie Kirk," said Mace, who spent the day trading social media barbs with Omar.  "We would love to see you deported back to Somalia," Mace tweeted at one point.  "You belong in rehab, not Congress," Omar replied.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>FOURSOME.</strong><span>  The four Republicans who refused to go along with Mace were Rep. Mike Flood (R-NE), Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-CO), Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), and Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL).  They all had similar concerns about punishing Omar.  This is a statement from Hurd:</span></p></li></ul><blockquote><p><em><strong>"Ilhan Omar’s comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, as well as her comments about those who supported Charlie, are ghoulish and evil. I condemn them completely. But I voted against today’s censure because it tried to strip another Member of Congress from committees and to silence her for exercising the First Amendment right to free speech. The right response to reprehensible speech like this isn’t silencing: it’s more speech. That’s what Charlie Kirk believed and practiced, and I agree."</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><strong>WORDS.</strong><span>  What exactly did Omar say?  Most Republicans never quoted anything from her, other than hinting that she said something awful about Kirk's killing.  "Literally none of this is true," Omar said, accusing Mace of making up statements.  In fact, the Mace censure offered no direct quotes at all from Omar.</span></p><div><hr/></div><p><strong>QUID PRO CORY.</strong><span>   But there is still one more unbelievable story from the Omar vote.  When Nancy Mace introduced her censure resolution, Democrats offered one against Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) - arguing he deserved punishment over allegations that he roughed up a young woman at his apartment in Washington, D.C.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>MARGIN.</strong><span>  In a 214-213 vote, every single member who voted to kill the Omar censure can be considered the 'key' vote.  If just one of those four Republicans voted the other way, Omar could have been thrown off her committees.  And one of those four was Cory Mills.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>STATEMENT.</strong><span>  Mills said his vote was all about Omar’s First Amendment rights.  "We may not like or agree with what someone says, but that does not mean we should deny their protected (First Amendment) Right."</span></p></li><li><p><strong>PSYCHE.</strong><span>   When the Omar vote was announced, the next order of business for the House was the censure proposed against Cory Mills.  But because the House killed the Omar censure, Democrats immediately dropped the Mills resolution.  Like I said in the headline above, Quid Pro Cory.</span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>(3) PATEL.</strong><span>  It was another day of verbal jabs and punches for the FBI Director, as he sparred with House Democrats in a second day of contentious hearings on Capitol Hill.  Wednesday was a 5-hour rehash of his 4-hour hearing on Tuesday before Senators, as Kash Patel defended his work on the Epstein Files and the investigation into Charlie Kirk’s murder.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>MOTIONS.</strong><span>  But the fun began after Patel's testimony finished.  Lawmakers scrapped for the next 20 minutes over requests for more evidence about the Epstein Files.  You won't be surprised to find out that Republicans defeated every single motion from Democrats to get more documents.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>TABLE.</strong><span>  Even before Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) had offered the first plan from Democrats, it was obvious what was coming from GOP lawmakers.  "I make a motion to table," a voice yelled from the GOP side, as Republicans made clear they would defeat every plan from Democrats.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>MORE VOTES.</strong><span>  At first, Raskin's motion to subpoena four major banks for 'suspicious activity records' was winning - but panel chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) simply held the vote open so Republicans could get back to the committee.  The GOP motion to table won 20-19.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>I MOVE TO TABLE.</strong><span>  Next up was Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA), who also wanted to subpoena information about bank transactions involving Epstein.  Republicans offered a motion to table while she was still talking.  "I didn't finish," Scanlon protested.  She lost 23-16.</span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>MASSIE.</strong><span>  One Republican consistently sided with Democrats on each motion.  That was Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who continues to be a lonely GOP voice for producing more Epstein documents.  It didn't used to be that way - until Donald Trump said the whole thing was a ‘Democrat hoax.’</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>SASSY.</strong><span>  "I told FBI Director Kash Patel that we know the FBI still has unreleased documents which contain 20 names of rich and politically connected men who Epstein trafficked girls and young women to," Massie said after the hearing.  "FBI needs to release the Epstein files and investigate these men."</span></p></li><li><p><strong>DISCHARGE.</strong><span>   Later this month, Massie will get a 218th signature on his discharge petition, which will force a vote on his bill to release more documents about Epstein.  It won’t be from any of his GOP colleagues.</span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>D.C. CRIME.</strong><span>  The Mayor of the District of Columbia goes before Congress today to testify about the recent federal anti-crime surge in the city.  Mayor Muriel Bowser </span><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO00/20250918/118631/HHRG-119-GO00-Wstate-BowserM-20250918.pdf" rel="">will again say</a><span> that push helped continue a reduction in violent crime.  "In the recent federal surge, we accelerated those gains, including a one-month reduction in carjackings of 75 percent."</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>ILLEGAL.</strong><span>  One flash point in today's hearing will likely be on illegal immigrants.  Mayor Bowser has said she does not want D.C. police handing over illegal aliens to federal agents - but that's exactly what President Trump wants, and GOP lawmakers are right behind him.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>IMMIGRANTS.</strong><span>  "It’s ridiculous that Mayor Bowser will no longer cooperate with ICE to detain criminal illegal aliens," said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA).  Earlier this week, President Trump threatened to again federalize the D.C. police - if Bowser and the city refused to cooperate with ICE immigration agents.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>RESOURCES.</strong><span>  Bowser is certain to stress that cracking down on crime requires more resources.  Either she needs more police officers or more federal agents to step in and help.  And that costs money.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>GO GO SWING</strong><span>.  Bowser will open her testimony today with a line that no one in Congress can say.  "I recently sent the Council our 30th consecutive balanced budget."  It's hard to believe, but while the Federal City has balanced its books - the House and Senate certainly have not.</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>BILLS.</strong><span>  The House yesterday approved two more GOP bills about the District of Columbia.  One changes how judicial nominees are chosen, while the other makes reforms in the police department.  Both face an uncertain future in the Senate.</span></p><div><hr/></div><p><strong>MUSE OF HISTORY. </strong><span> September 18, 1968.  Just months after the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy, the Senate voted 70-17 </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/90/statute/STATUTE-82/STATUTE-82-Pg1213-2.pdf" rel="">on this date</a><span> to approve what ultimately became the Gun Control Act of 1968. "The Senate has declared itself today on the side of law enforcement and prevention of gun crimes," said Sen. Thomas Dodd (D-CT). </span></p><div><hr/></div><p><strong>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM:</strong></p><p>The House convenes at 10 am.</p><p>The Senate meets at 10 am.</p><p><span>Follow me on Twitter </span><a href="http://twitter.com/jamiedupree" rel="">@jamiedupree</a><span>.
