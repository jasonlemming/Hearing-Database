Shutdowns are dumb.  Shutdowns are stupid.  Shutdowns are easy to start.  Shutdowns are not easy to end.  And that’s where the Congress is stuck already.  This is day 4 of the 2025 federal government shutdown.  And I’m not sure it’s going to end anytime soon.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>SENATE.</strong><span>  As expected, the Senate deadlocked for a fourth time on Friday, as a filibuster led by Democrats blocked action again on a House-passed temporary government funding bill.  The next vote is expected on Monday.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>SWITCHES.</strong><span>  The same Senators switched sides.  Cortez Masto D-NV, Fetterman D-PA, and King I-ME all voted for the House-passed CR.  Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) again voted with Democrats to filibuster.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>VIBE CHECK.</strong><span>  As Senators headed for the airport, I sure didn’t feel much reason for optimism.  Yes - Senators are talking, but there didn’t seem to be much evidence that they had a viable plan to end the shutdown.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>REOPEN.</strong><span>  GOP Senators were in unison about one thing - they aren’t going to start negotiating a deal with Democrats on anything until the government gets funded again.  </span></p></li><li><p><strong>TALKS.</strong><span>  “End the shutdown, and lots of things can fall into place,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), who has been in the middle of talks with some Democrats. </span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>MORIARTY.</strong><span>  One of the few Senators to give off positive vibes about a solution on Friday was Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).  “I’m actually relatively encouraged,” Murkowski said as she was swarmed by reporters while leaving the Capitol.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>LAST FRONTIER.</strong><span>  “I think that there’s a lot of good faith effort to try to end a shutdown that we shouldn’t be in,” Murkowski added.  </span></p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png" rel="" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":454,"width":321,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":263115,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":"image/png","href":null,"belowTheFold":false,"topImage":true,"internalRedirect":"https://jamiedupree.substack.com/i/175218782?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png","isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' fetchpriority="high" height="454" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!42Jc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c3d753-6ddd-4638-88c8-fbccdf195b7d_321x454.png 1456w" width="321"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr/></div><p><strong>LET’S MAKE A DEAL.</strong><span>  But some GOP Senators still seemed incredulous at the idea of giving in to Democrats on subsidies for insurance under the Obama health exchanges as part of a temporary funding deal.  “What do you negotiate?” asked Sen.

It was announced that there would be no votes in the House until at least October 14 (!!!) - as Republicans say the House-passed temporary funding bill is their final offer.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>BACK HOME.</strong><span>  “These guys are on almost permanent vacay like for real,” said Sen.

That’s a lot of wasted time.</span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>EPSTEIN.</strong><span>   The House GOP decision to take another week off from legislative business also means the newest member of the House won’t be sworn in next week.

One more vote for accountability?”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>APRIL.</strong><span>  Just a reminder - two House Republicans were elected on April 1 and sworn in on April 2, even though there was no legislative business in the House.

We say hello to them all the time as we come through the doors on Capitol Hill - but now, they want to know, when is it going to end?</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>END GAME.</strong><span>  How does this battle end?  It usually ends with one side caving.  And in my over 35 years of covering shutdowns, one thing has always been true: the side that gives in has always been the party which started the shutdown.</span></p></li></ul><div><hr/></div><p><strong>COINS.</strong><span>   You might have seen these floating around on the internet yesterday.
