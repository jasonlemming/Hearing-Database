<p><b>Whereas</b> the designation of sex is essential for data collection, statistics, and policy for many functions of the state, including public health, education, the protection of sex-specific spaces, rights and resources, the protection of the rights and safety of incarcerated people, and the recording of crimes, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> the designation of sex must be accurate for the state to perform these functions and to protect of the rights and safety of its citizens,</p>
<p><b>Therefore</b>, it is the intent of the legislature of the [state/commonwealth of__________] to ensure the integrity and accuracy of its vital records by enacting the following provisions.</p>
<p><b>I. Definitions</b></p>
<p>An individual’s sex refers to whether someone is male or female, which is distinguished based on the type of gamete (sperm or eggs) they are capable of or expected to produce, as dictatedbytheir primary sexual anatomy. Because there are only two types of gamete (sperm and ova), with two corresponding reproductive systems, there are only two sexes—male and female. An individual’s sex is rooted in reproductive anatomy and is in no way influenced or definedbyone’s psychological state, behavior, expression, or personal identity.</p>
<p>The female sex is characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing eggs (ova).</p>
<p>The male sex is characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing sperm.</p>
<p>For purposes of vital and other state records:</p>
<p>“Sex,” when used to refer to a natural person, means his or her biological sex, either male or female.</p>
<p>“Female,” when used to refer to a natural person, means an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or would have—but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption—the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes eggs for fertilization.</p>
<p>“Male,” when used to refer to a natural person, means an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or would have—but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption—the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes sperm for fertilization.</p>
<p>“Vital record” means any official record of a natural person or life event issued and maintained by the [state/commonwealth of_______], including certificate of birth, certificate of marriage or divorce and certificate of death.</p>
<p>“State record” means any official record of the [state/commonwealth of_______], including but not limited to driver’s license, driver’s permit, or other identifying document, and any educational, health, judicial and criminal records.</p>
<p><b>II. Vital Records, in General</b></p>
