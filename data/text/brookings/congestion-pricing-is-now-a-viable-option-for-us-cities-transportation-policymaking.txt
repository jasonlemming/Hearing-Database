The Metropolitan Transportation Authority earlier this month launched New York City’s congestion pricing program, with early indications the program is achieving its aims.

After many exploratory efforts across the country, this is the first time any American metropolitan area is charging drivers to enter an entire zone of their central city, in this case Manhattan below 60th Street.

Ayear ago Iwrote in Bloomberg’s CityLab about why the success of New York’s congestion pricing experiment could quickly be replicated in other American cities.

As Iwrote at the time:
“What makes New York’s congestion pricing such an important development is what it means for every other congested American city.

Even though cities around the world have successfully launched congestion pricing programs for half a century, US elected officials have exhibited far less courage, frequently stopping at small pilots or resident surveys.”
