# Phase 2.3: Enhanced Iterative Validation - ITERATIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**Status**: Planning (Using Iterative Framework)
**Start Date**: TBD
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 weeks
**Approach**: Incremental with Validation Gates

---

## Overview

Phase 2.3 adds enhanced validation capabilities to the update system, building on Phase 2.2. **Unlike Phase 2.2, this phase will use the Iterative Implementation Framework** with validation gates between stages.

---

## Phase Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Enable partial success (batch processing with independent validation)
2. Detect pattern-based anomalies (not just threshold-based)
3. Reduce risk of large failed updates

### Success Metrics (Defined Upfront)
- **Reliability**: 95% of batches succeed (vs 0% or 100% currently)
- **Detection**: Catch 90% of pattern anomalies (measured against synthetic test data)
- **Performance**: < 10% additional overhead vs Phase 2.2
- **Quality**: < 5% false positive rate on validation

---

## Stage Breakdown

Phase 2.3 is divided into **3 stages**, each with validation gates:

```
Phase 2.3
│
├─ Stage 2.3.1: Batch Processing (Week 1-2)
│  └─ Core capability for partial success
│
├─ Stage 2.3.2: Historical Validation (Week 3)
│  └─ Pattern-based anomaly detection
│
└─ Stage 2.3.3: Integration & Production Pilot (Week 4-5)
   └─ Integrate stages, deploy with canary
```

---

## Stage 2.3.1: Batch Processing with Validation Checkpoints

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Goal**: Enable processing updates in batches with independent validation

---

### Planning Gate (Day 1)

**Problem Statement**:
Current system processes all updates in one transaction. If validation fails, entire update is rolled back, wasting processing time and rejecting good data along with bad.

**Proposed Solution**:
Process updates in batches of 50 hearings. Validate each batch independently. Skip/rollback only failed batches.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Can process 500 hearings in 10 batches
- [ ] Failed batch doesn't affect other batches
- [ ] Good batches committed even if some batches fail
- [ ] Performance: < 5 seconds for 500 hearings (10s previously)
- [ ] Reliability: >= 95% of good data committed (vs 0% on any failure)

**Dependencies**:
- Phase 2.2 backup/rollback system (already exists)
- Database transaction support (already exists)

**Risks & Mitigation**:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Batch size too small = slow | Medium | Medium | Make batch size configurable, test multiple sizes |
| Batch validation too strict | Medium | High | Track false positive rate, adjust thresholds |
| Partial commits cause inconsistency | Low | High | Validate cross-batch relationships after all batches |
| Checkpointing fails | Low | High | Fall back to Phase 2.2 all-or-nothing approach |

**Rollback Plan**:
- Feature flag: `ENABLE_BATCH_PROCESSING = True/False`
- If issues, set flag to False, fall back to Phase 2.2 behavior
- No data loss risk (using existing backup system)

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
1. **Batch size = 1** (validate every hearing): Too slow
2. **Adaptive batch size** (smaller for risky updates): Too complex for v1
3. **No batch validation** (only final validation): Doesn't solve problem

**Effort Estimate**: 8-10 days
- Development: 4 days
- Testing: 2 days
- Review: 1 day
- Trial: 2-3 days

**Decision**: ✅ Proceed / ❌ Revise / ❌ Abort

---

### Development (Day 2-5)

4. Implement `_apply_batch_updates()` method
5. Implement `_validate_batch()` method
6. Modify `run_daily_update()` to use batch processing
7. Add batch metrics to `UpdateMetrics` class
8. Add feature flag for enabling/disabling

**Code Locations**:

## Stage 2.3.2: Historical Pattern Validation

**Duration**: 1 week
**Goal**: Detect anomalies based on historical patterns, not just static thresholds

**Note**: This stage builds on 2.3.1. Requires 2.3.1 to be complete.

---

### Planning Gate (Day 13)

**Problem Statement**:
Phase 2.2 anomaly detection uses static thresholds (> 1000 hearings, > 3x average). This misses subtle patterns and generates false positives on seasonal variations.

**Proposed Solution**:
Validate current update against historical patterns using statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, trend analysis).

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Detect 90% of synthetic pattern anomalies (created for testing)
- [ ] False positive rate < 5% on historical data
- [ ] Add < 500ms overhead to validation
- [ ] Works with at least 30 days of history (doesn't require years)

**Dependencies**:
- At least 30 update logs with metrics (should exist from Phase 2.2)
- Stage 2.3.1 completed and stable

**Risks & Mitigation**:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Insufficient historical data | Medium | High | Graceful degradation: use static thresholds if < 30 days |
| False positives on real changes | Medium | Medium | Use multiple signals, require 2+ anomalies to alert |
| Performance overhead | Low | Medium | Cache historical stats, recalculate daily not per update |
| Complex to tune | High | Medium | Provide admin UI for threshold adjustment |

**Rollback Plan**:
- Feature flag: `ENABLE_HISTORICAL_VALIDATION = True/False`
- If too many false positives, disable and tune offline

**Effort Estimate**: 5-6 days
- Development: 3 days
- Testing: 1 day
- Review: 1 day
- Trial: 1-2 days

**Decision**: ✅ Proceed / ❌ Revise / ❌ Abort

---

### Development (Day 14-16)

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. Create `HistoricalValidator` class
2. Implement `_calculate_historical_stats()` method
3. Implement `_detect_pattern_anomalies()` method

5. Add caching for historical stats (recalculate daily)
6. Integrate with existing validation in `_run_post_update_validation()`
7. Add historical validation metrics to `UpdateMetrics`
8. Add feature flag

**Code Locations**:
- `scripts/verify_updates.py`: Add `HistoricalValidator` class
- `updaters/daily_updater.py`: Integrate historical validation

**Statistical Approaches**:
- **Z-score**: (value - mean) / std_dev > 3 = anomaly
- **Moving average**: Compare to 7-day, 30-day moving averages
- **Day-of-week patterns**: Monday vs Friday may differ normally
- **Trend analysis**: Detect sudden reversals in trends

**Test-Driven Development**:
- `test_calculate_historical_stats()`: Test stat calculation

- `test_insufficient_history()`: Test graceful degradation
- `test_historical_validation_integration()`: Test with full system
