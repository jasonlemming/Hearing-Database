## Production Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Deployment with Flag Disabled (Week 1)

**Objective**: Deploy to production, confirm Phase 2.2 baseline

**Steps**:
1. Deploy code to production
2. Verify `ENABLE_BATCH_PROCESSING=false` (default)
3. Run daily updates for 7 days
4. Monitor Phase 2.2 performance baseline
5. Verify no regression

**Success Criteria**:
- No errors in production
- Performance matches expectations
- Database integrity maintained

**Duration**: 7 days

---

### Phase 2: Enable Batch Processing (Week 2)

**Objective**: Enable batch processing, monitor behavior

**Steps**:
1. Set `ENABLE_BATCH_PROCESSING=true` via environment variable
2. Run first update with batch processing
3. Monitor logs for:
   - Batch count
   - Success/failure rates
   - Processing duration
   - Error messages
4. Continue monitoring for 7 days
5. Compare metrics with Phase 2.2 baseline

**Success Criteria**:
- Batch processing activates successfully
- Performance within Â±10% of Phase 2.2
- No data corruption
- >= 95% batch success rate

**Duration**: 7 days

---

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3+)

2. System immediately reverts to Phase 2.2
3. Document issue thoroughly
4. Fix in development
5. Re-test
6. Re-deploy

**Critical Issues** (abort):
1. Set `ENABLE_BATCH_PROCESSING=false`
2. Restore database from backup if corruption detected
3. Full rollback to previous deployment
4. Post-mortem analysis
5. Return to Development Phase
