4. **API Support**: Congress.gov API has excellent member endpoints
5. **Foundation for Bills**: Member data helps with bill sponsor/cosponsor tracking later

**What You'll Get**:
- Member profiles (name, party, state, district, bio)
- Committee memberships with roles (Chair, Ranking Member, Member)
- Historical membership tracking
- Member-based queries and filtering
- Foundation for bill integration (sponsors, cosponsors)

**After Members, Then**:
- Phase 3.2 (Bills) - Natural next step, connects to members
- Phase 2.5 (Monitoring) - Professional operational capability
